## Functionality üí™
#### Here's how the app works: 
1. This is a web app that allows users to scrape the news from another website. The website used in this site is Nomadic Matt's Travel Blog. 

    1.1 The Scrape Articles button will populate the page with  the latest articles from Nomadic Matt's blog. 

    1.2 To clear all articles from the page simply click on the Clear Articles button.

2. Each article card has a headling, an image, and two links at the bottom. 

    2.1 The user can either View the article from the Nomadic Matt website, or they can save the article to a new page on this site. 

3. After saving a couple of articles, click on the Saved Articles link on the top right corner of the page. 

    3.1 On the saved page the user will see each article they have saved and an option to comment on the article.

    3.2 There is an option to delete articles from the saved page and also to delete the comments after one is written. 

## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for grading and testing purposes. 

1. Clone repository. Click on the clone button next to the repository (clone with SSH). 
2. Open Terminal and git clone (paste) into directory of your choice. 
3. Open folder in VS Code. 
4. The file structure follows an MVC pattern with the main diretories being `models`, `public`, `routes`, `views`, and a                `server.js` file connecting the app to the server and the correct port. 
5. the `models` folder handles the data of the application. 
6. `public` holds the assets, css, images and the javascript which holds all the necessary 'on click' functions.
7. The `routes` folder holds the logic for the routes which receives the user input, validates it and passes it through the modls.
8. Inside of the `views` folder are the handlebars files which dynamically displays information on the web page.
