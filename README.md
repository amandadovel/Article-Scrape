## Functionality üí™
#### Here's how the app works: 
1. This is a web app that allows users to scrape the news from another website. The website used in this site is Nomadic Matt's Travel Blog. 

    1.1 The Scrape Articles button will populate the page with  the latest articles from Nomadic Matt's blog. 

    1.2 To clear all articles from the page simply click on the Clear Articles button.

2. Each article card has a headling, an image, and two links at the bottom. 

    2.1 The user can either View the article from the Nomadic Matt website, or they can save the article to a new page on this site. 

3. After saving a couple of articles, click on the Saved Articles link on the top right corner of the page. 

    3.1 On the saved page the user will see each article they have saved and an option to comment on the article.

    3.2 There is an option to delete articles from the saved page and also to delete the comments after one is written.
